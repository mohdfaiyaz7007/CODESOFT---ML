PROJECT : MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION
The Movie Genre Classification project aims to automatically categorize movies into genres based on their plot summaries and other textual information. Utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques like TF-IDF vectorization and classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), the project develops a model to predict genres accurately. This project enhances movie categorization for recommendation systems, search optimization, and better database organization, demonstrating the practical application of machine learning in the entertainment industry.

PROJECT : CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION
The Customer Churn Prediction project aims to identify customers who are likely to discontinue using a company's products or services by analyzing historical customer data to understand patterns and indicators of churn. The project involves collecting comprehensive data on customer interactions, transactions, demographics, and behavior, followed by cleaning and preprocessing the data to handle missing values, normalize variables, and encode categorical features. Relevant features are then identified and created to capture characteristics and behaviors indicative of churn. Machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks are utilized to build predictive models, which are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve to ensure robust predictions.

PROJECT : SPAM SMS DETECTION
The Spam SMS Detection project aims to identify and filter out unwanted spam messages from legitimate SMS communications. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, the project builds a model to accurately classify SMS messages as spam or non-spam. Key steps include data preprocessing to clean and tokenize the text, feature extraction using methods like TF-IDF vectorization, and training classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). This project helps improve communication efficiency and security by automatically filtering spam messages, showcasing the practical impact of AI in enhancing everyday digital interactions.
